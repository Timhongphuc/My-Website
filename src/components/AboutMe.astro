        Hi, I'm Tim, a high school developer from Germany.
        <br />
        My primary tools of choice include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>Swift</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Vercel</li>
        <li>Astro</li>
        <li>VSCode</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about design, 3D modelling, 3D Printing and traveling.
      A few hobbys of mine are biking and making music, they're
      some really important pieces to me.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project.
